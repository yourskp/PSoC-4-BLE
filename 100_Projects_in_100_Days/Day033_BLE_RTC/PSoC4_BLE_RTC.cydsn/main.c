*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
*******************************************************************************
* This project demonstrates PSoC 4 BLE acting as a BLE time client that syncs 
* time from an iOS device (iOS support time server out of the box) and runs an 
* RTC in PSoC 4 BLE.
*
*******************************************************************************
*                                 NOTES
*******************************************************************************
* This project will best work with iOS devices as iOS supports Current Time 
* Service (CTS) out of the box. On othee BLE Central devices (Android, Cypress's
* CySmart Host Emulation tool etc.), the RTC will start from time 0 after it 
* discovers that CTS client is not supported by the peer device.
*
* Device "Debug Select" option in project's .cydwr file's "system" tab is set to 
* GPIO to reduce power consumption of the device. If you like to debug this 
* example project, change the "Debug Select" option to SWD.
*
* System heap memory size is set to 1K in .cydwr -> system tab. This is required
* for using printf function in this example. Set the heap size to 0 (to reduce 
* SRAM consumption of the project) if you have disabled the console log
